# Self-Hosted Netbird Stack with Hardening & Monitoring

This repository contains a reference implementation for a self-hosted **Netbird Management Server** setup using Docker Compose. The configuration focuses on stability, resource efficiency, and compliance with standard infrastructure protection baselines (e.g., aligning with BSI IT-Grundschutz modules for containerization).

It is designed for system administrators in public sector environments or SMEs who require a reliable overlay network without relying on external SaaS control planes.

## Features

- **Full Stack Deployment**: Includes Management, Dashboard, Signal, Relay, and Coturn (STUN/TURN).
- **Advanced Threat Detection**:
  - **CrowdSec IPS**: Integrated Security Engine with **custom parsers** for Netbird Management and Coturn logs.
  - **Firewall Bouncer**: Direct integration with `nftables`/`iptables` to block malicious IPs at the network layer.
  - **Behavioral Analysis**: Custom scenarios to detect auth-brute-forcing and relay abuse.
- **Network Isolation**: Coturn runs with specific port bindings instead of `host` mode to maintain Docker network segregation.
- **Identity Provider**: Supports external OIDC providers (e.g., JumpCloud) with OAuth2-Proxy for admin access.
- **Resource Limits**: Log rotation and container restart policies configured for long-term maintenance-free operation.
- **IPv6 Support**: Configured for dual-stack environments.

## Architecture

The stack consists of the following components:

1. **Caddy**: Reverse Proxy for Dashboard and API endpoints (TLS termination).
2. **Netbird Core**: Management, Signal, and Relay services.
3. **Coturn**: VoIP media relay (TURN/STUN) with restricted port ranges and network isolation.
4. **OAuth2-Proxy**: Protects admin access via OIDC (JumpCloud, Okta, etc.).
5. **CrowdSec Stack**: 
   - **Security Engine**: Reads logs from all containers via `acquis.yaml`.
   - **Firewall Bouncer**: Applies decisions (bans) directly to the host firewall.

## Security Architecture

### CrowdSec Configuration
The stack bridges the gap between application logs and network defense:
1. **Log Acquisition**: Centralized acquisition via `acquis.yaml` mapping container logs to specific labels.
2. **Parsing**: Custom Grok patterns decode Netbird's specific log formats (Go-based logging) and Coturn's STUN/TURN allocation logs.
3. **Remediation**: A dedicated Firewall Bouncer container applies blocklists directly to the host's `INPUT` chain, protecting all Docker containers effectively.

### Compliance Notes
- **Log Rotation**: Strict limits (e.g., 50MB) per container to ensure audit trails without disk exhaustion.
- **Privacy**: Parsers are configured to anonymize sensitive user data before processing.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (recommended)
- Docker Engine & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
- Public IPv4 and IPv6 address
- DNS records pointing to your server IP (e.g., `netbird.example.com`)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/patrick-bloem/Netbird-self-hosted-stack.git
cd Netbird-self-hosted-stack


### 2. Initialize directories
Run the initialization script to create the necessary folder structure, log directories, and placeholder configs.
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh

### 3. Configuration
Copy the example environment file and adjust the variables to your infrastructure.
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

*Note: Ensure to generate strong secrets for `OAUTH2_COOKIE_SECRET` and any NetBird relay/TURN secrets.*

### 4. Deployment
Start the stack in detached mode.
docker compose up -d

### 5. Post-Deployment: CrowdSec Bouncer
Once the stack is running, generate an API key for the Firewall Bouncer and add it to your `.env` file.
Generate Key
docker compose exec crowdsec cscli bouncers add firewall-bouncer

Add to .env
nano .env # Set CROWDSEC_BOUNCER_KEY=...

Restart Bouncer
docker compose up -d --force-recreate cs-firewall-bouncer

## Admin Access to Management API

NetBird clients must reach the Management API and gRPC endpoints without OAuth2-Proxy.
If you want **admin-only** access to the Management API, add an **admin subdomain**
proxied through OAuth2-Proxy while keeping the public endpoints open for clients.

Recommended approach:
- `netbird.example.com` (public for clients, dashboard protected)
- `admin.netbird.example.com` (admin-only Management API via OAuth2-Proxy)

## Maintenance & Logs

Logs are configured with a `json-file` driver and rotation policies to prevent disk exhaustion.

### Monitoring Security Status
To inspect CrowdSec metrics and active bans:
Show metrics
docker compose exec crowdsec cscli metrics

List active bans
docker compose exec crowdsec cscli decisions list

This configuration is provided "as is" for educational and administrative purposes. While it follows general hardening guidelines, please verify against your specific organizational compliance requirements before deploying in production.
